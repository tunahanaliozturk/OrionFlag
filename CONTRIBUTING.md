# Contributing to OrionFlag

Thanks for taking the time to look at this. OrionFlag is feature flags that evaluate in-process with zero network per check. The project is small and the bar for contributions is "does it make the package clearer, faster, or safer without expanding the public surface needlessly."

## Before you open a PR

For anything beyond a typo, a docs tweak, or a one-line fix, please open an issue first. Five minutes of alignment up front saves an afternoon of rework later. State:

- The use case you are trying to solve
- What you tried that did not work
- Whether you want to send the patch yourself or are flagging the gap

For typos, docs polish, comment fixes, single-line changes, please skip the issue and send a PR directly. Title it `docs: ...` or `chore: ...` so it is obvious from the queue.

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tunahanaliozturk/OrionFlag
cd OrionFlag
dotnet restore
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet test
```

.NET 8 SDK is required. Multi-target builds may need 9.0 / 10.0 SDKs installed; the multi-target dimension is intentional and not optional.

Branch from `main`. Name the branch after intent: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`, `refactor/...`, `chore/...`, `test/...`.

## Pull request shape

- One conceptual change per PR. Refactors and behaviour changes go in separate PRs even if the diff feels small.
- Conventional Commits style commit subject (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.).
- New behaviour comes with tests. Bug fixes come with a failing-before, passing-after test.
- Public API additions need XML doc comments. Breaking changes need a CHANGELOG entry.
- No `Co-Authored-By` trailers. The author of the PR is the author of the work.

## Coding style

- The repo enforces analyzer warnings as errors and `latest-recommended` analysis mode. Treat warnings as bugs.
- Match the surrounding code style. If the existing code does X, do X.
- Names are spelled out. No `mgr`, `svc`, `ctx`. The exceptions are well-known abbreviations (`Id`, `Db`, `Url`, `Ab`).
- Comments explain why, not what. The code already says what.
- The evaluation hot path is the product: `IsEnabled` must stay a lock-free, allocation-free read of an immutable snapshot, and a snapshot captured for a request must never change under a live reload. A change that adds a lock or an allocation to the hot path, or that lets a pinned snapshot mutate, is a regression.

## Tests

- xUnit.
- Test names are sentences with underscores: `A_captured_snapshot_does_not_flip_when_config_reloads`.
- Reload behaviour is tested with a controllable `IOptionsMonitor`, not by touching real files.
- Coverage is a side effect of writing tests for behaviour, not a target in itself.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:

- A minimal reproduction (the flag config and the evaluation, ideally less than 50 lines)
- The actual behaviour vs the expected behaviour
- The runtime (`dotnet --info` output) and the package version

If the bug has security implications, please email the maintainer privately before opening a public issue.

## Security

Do not file public issues for vulnerabilities. Contact the maintainer directly. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) if present, otherwise email the address listed in the package NuGet metadata.

## Conduct

Be kind. We follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Disagreement is fine; rudeness is not.
